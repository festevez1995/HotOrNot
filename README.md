# Hot Or Not?
For this lab, I learned how to interface a Nucleo board with a temperature sensor using Integer-Intergrated Circuit (I2C) communication. This type of communication lets us interface with serial communication. Additionaly, I also learned how to use numpys library to be able to export to a CSV file.
